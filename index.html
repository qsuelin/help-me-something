            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Gardening makes me Ceaser of my patio. My plants serve as my loyal soilders and I talk to them everyday. 
               I believe they also like petty talks, so I keep on have sweet talks with them, give them comliments so that someday, I can ... <em>EAT</em> them.</p>
            <p>Other than all the sweet talks, I figure out the key ingredients of successful gardening are:
            <ul>
               <li>sun</li>
               <li>water</li>
               <li>soil</li>
             </ul>
            </p>
         </article>

            <h3>Who Are They</h3>
            <p>I start with herbs, because they cost so much in grocery stores. But once the Pandora box got openned, I simply cannot stop.</p>
            <p>So far I have basil, parsley, tomato, brocolli, carrots, angular, lettuce and strawberry.</p>
